Internationalization Quick Guide
--------------------------------

To register a new language to add to translations edit the warehauser\settings.py:

LANGUAGES = [
    ('<language code>', _('<language name>')),
]

where <language code> is the 2 letter code for your new language, and <language name> is the English name of the language. So for example:

    ('en', _('English')), # for English
    ('de', _('German')),  # for German

From the warehauser project base directory run the following command:

    django-admin makemessages -l <language code>

A few files will be created in the warehauser project directory:

    locale\<language code>\LC_MESSAGES\django.po

For each language you created. Open each such file in a text editor of your choice and add translations. Each message to translate will be in the form of:

    #: .\warehauser\settings.py:270
    msgid "English"
    msgstr ""

For each add the translation string in the double quotes "" of msgstr.

IMPORTANT: Some "msgid" will have "{variable}" strings. The msgstr MUST have the same "{variable}" EXACTLY as it appears in the msgid. For example:

    msgid "Some text {variable.somefunc()}"
    msgstr "<translation text for Some text> {variable.somefunc()}"
